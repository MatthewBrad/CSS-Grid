        <img src="hiking1arrow.jpg" alt="Arrow" width="300px" height="200px">

          <p>This route goes up the fabulous India—Venster Route, follows a spectacular traverse on the face of Table Mountain, and then descends steeply down Yellowstone Gully: not for the faint-hearted! If you were even slightly out of your comfort zone on the India—Venster scrambles, don’t proceed!</p>

          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Getting there: park your car at Kloof Corner on Table Mountain Road.</li>
              <li>Difficulty: do not attempt without guide: extreme exposure, scrambling, route-finding.</li>
              <li>Distance: 4km.</li>
              <li>GPS Co-ordinates: S 33°56.856′, E 18°24.122′</li>

<h3>Tranquility Cracks Hiking</h3><br/>

      <img src="hiking2tranq.jpg" alt="Traanquility" width="300px" height="200px">

        <p>Tranquility Cracks refers directly to deep fissures in the rocks above Camps Bay through which one passes, about halfway along the Twelve Apostles. Beyond the cracks is a labyrinth of rocky corridors. There are a number of passages to choose from, all of which offer incredible views. Inside the cracks grow yellowwood trees that have earned the hike the alternative title of Yellowwood Cracks. Here you are sheltered from any wind and sun.</p>

          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Getting there: Start at the Pipe Track above Camps Bay, take Corridor Ravine to the top of the mountain and finish at the Pipe Track.</li>

              <li>Duration: roughly 5 hours, depending on your level of fitness.</li>

<h3>Wittels Hiking</h3><br/>

          <img src="hiking3wit.jpg" alt="Witels" width="300px" height="200px">

            <p>The Witels is a remote stream of the mountainous Boland of South Africa and flows through rugged sandstone ranges some 60 km east of Cape Town. Access is quite difficult in summer and for practical purposes impossible in winter, when the canyon ("kloof" in Afrikaans) is in high flood. This river is perfect for hiking but you may need a few days to make the most of it!</p>
